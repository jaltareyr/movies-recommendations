# Movies Recommendations

I aim to learn and apply advanced recommendation methods such as content-based and collaborative filtering in this project. I have decided to use a large movie dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv). 

The dataset consists of these files

- `movies_metadata.csv`
- `credits.csv`
- `keywords.csv`
- `ratings.csv`
- `ratings_small.csv`

These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts, and vote averages.

This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.

This repository is currently under work in progress and hence kept private. I intend to work on mainly static, content-based, and finally collaborative filtering methods to develop a reliable and robust movie recommender system.
